//Variables: There are 3  types; var, let and const
// var and let are used to declare variables that change while const is used for variables that never change

let favouriteColor = "red"
//var myName = "Joshua"
const PI = "3.142"
console.log(PI)

//There are 2 major data types
//Fundamental data type: we have 6 of them
//Reference data type

//Fundamental data type
// String: combination of characters or a word. It is always in quote.
// Numbers
// Booleans
// Undefined
// Null
// Symbol
//let age = "21" // number
let isMarried = "false" //boolean
let favouriteClub;
//When you assign a variable to a const variable, it would result into an error


//Operations on Datatypes
//Arithmetic Operations
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y;

//Operations on Strings
// Concatenation
//let occupation = "Engineer";
//let favClub = "Barcelona";
//let occupaClub = occupation + " " + favClub;

//To convert a string to uppercase or lowercase
//let favClubUpper = favClub.toUpperCase();
//let favClubLower = favClub.toLowerCase();

//Operations on Booleans
//There are only 2 values for booleans: true or false
//logic gates - AND, OR, NOT
//Boolean is used when we're performing logical operations
//AND- && Double Ampersand. It's only true if both left and right operands are true
let jamesAge = 30;
let standardAge = 18;
console.log(standardAge && true)

//OR- || is true if either side is true (either left or right operands are true)
let age = "16"
let legalAge = 18;
let gender = "female"
//console.log(age>=legalAge || gender== "male" && "I can drink alcohol")

// NOT- ! is used to reverse the logical state of its operand
// That is, it converts true to false and false to true

//console.log(!false)
//console.log(!true)
//console.log( !"I love you")

//TRUTHY AND FALSY VALUES
//Truthy values are values that evaluate to true in a boolean context e.g numbers, strings, objects, arrays
//Falsy values are values that evaluate to false in a boolean context e.g undefined, null

//console.log(Boolean("Joshua"))

//CONDITIONALS

//if(){

//}

//else{

//}
